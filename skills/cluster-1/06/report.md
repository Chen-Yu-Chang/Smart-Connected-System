## Summary
1. I built a directory (console_i/o) to put all the codes, CMakeList.txt, Makefile.
2. I altered the text of CMakeList.txt to contain the right project.
3. I wrote a console_i_o.c that is in the code folder.
4. I configured and build the project and I can successfully switch the three modes.
