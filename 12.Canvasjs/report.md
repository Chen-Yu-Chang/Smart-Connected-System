## Summary
1. I read the examples in CanvasJS, learning the basic implementations of how to code a correct graph that I want.
2. I created a graph based on the data given in stocks-csv.txt.
3. I wrote another code, app.js, to take the file as input and plot the graph showing in local:4000. The graph is the 4 big tech companies' 10 days of closing price. I plot it separated from day1 to day10.
